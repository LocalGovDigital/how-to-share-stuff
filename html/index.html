				How to Share Stuff <small>A basic guide for how to share
					code and other stuff</small>
			</h1>
		</div>
		<h2>What to do before you share</h2>
		<h3>Get permission</h3>
		<p>If you’re employed by an organisation to do something, it’s
			more than likely they own whatever you produce. This means you need
			to get their permission before you share their stuff.</p>
		<p>The ease of this can range from asking your boss once, to
			having to put together a case for doing so, taking this to senior
			management and if approved getting every share signed-off.</p>
		<h3>Be secure</h3>
		<p>Never share anything containing passwords, keys, private data,
			or anything similar. If you don’t take this seriously you could be
			risking a visit from the Information Commissioner's Office and you
			could be opening systems and third party accounts up for the world to
			access.</p>
		<h3>If in doubt, ask.</h3>
		<p>If you’re ever unsure about what you can share or how to share
			it, it’s always better to check first. Information made available
			online is very difficult, if not impossible, to remove. Data
			protection officers, data owners and other stakeholders will be able
			to advise on the most appropriate way options for sharing things.</p>
		<p>If you’re still unsure, you can always ask online to see if
			anyone else has had a similar experience.</p>
		<h2>Where to share</h2>
		<p>There are plenty of code repository sites for open source
			projects, but GitHub is the most popular. Code repositories like
			GitHub allow people to share their work and for others to suggest
			changes.</p>
		<p>
			You can sign up as a user and add your organisation, for example
			here’s <a href="https://github.com/LocalGovDigital">LocalGovDigital
				on GitHub</a>.
		</p>
		<h2>Licences</h2>
		<p>Using a licence will clearly define how you want your content
			to be shared. It’s a good idea to share using a licence so that other
			know in which ways they can use your code. For example if you don’t
			want your code to be used commercially, you can choose a licence that
			specifies this.</p>
		<p>There are many to choose from and it needs to take account of
			the agreement you have with your employer to share your work.</p>
		<h3>Software</h3>
		<p>
			<a href="http://choosealicense.com/">http://choosealicense.com/</a> A
			useful guide on the basic options for software licenses.
		</p>
		<h3>Content</h3>
		<p>
			A good way to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/license/">choose
				a Creative Commons licence is here</a> or you might like to use <a
				href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/2/">one
				designed for open government here</a>.
		</p>
		<h2>How to share</h2>
		<h3>Github</h3>
		<p>Github is, in crude and simple terms, an online service for
			storing files. Although originally aimed at developers storing code,
			Github has been adopted outside the development world as a great
			method for sharing and collaborating.</p>
		<p>
			You can store your files on Github publicly, for free. You group
			files into a ‘repository’ for example the LocalGov Digital Github
			account is <a href="https://github.com/LocalGovDigital">here</a> and
			within that we have the <a
				href="https://github.com/LocalGovDigital/content-standards">Content
				Standards repository</a> which contains all the files that make up the
			Content Standards guidance.
		</p>
		<p>So as you share more and more, your account will contain many
			repositories, think of them as projects if the terminology feels
			alien.</p>
		<p>The advantages to a service like Github is that the files you
			store can be quickly copied or ‘forked’ by other users of Github and
			the changes other users make can be ‘merged’ back into your version,
			which makes for a great culture of open collaboration.</p>
		<p>Getting files onto Github</p>
		<p>Sadly, Github doesn’t have an ‘upload’ button. The idea is that
			you have a version of the repository on your computer and a copy on
			Github.</p>
		<p>When you make a change to the files in the repository on your
			computer, you ‘commit’ to those changes and then you ‘push’ those
			changes from your computer to Github. Each time you ‘commit’ to some
			changes, you create a new version of the file. It’s a bit like
			clicking ‘File &gt; Save As..’ except the changes are stored on
			Github.</p>
		<p>One of the easiest methods for getting your files onto Github
			is using a desktop application.</p>
		<p>Github have made desktop applications available, again
			completely free. You can download them here:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://windows.github.com/">Github for Windows</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://mac.github.com/">Github for Mac</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>As most local government organisations use Windows, here are
			the steps for setting up your first repository and adding some files
			to it.</p>
		<h4>Setting up Github for Windows</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>If you haven’t already done so, go to <a
				href="https://github.com/">Github</a> and sign up for an account
			</li>
			<li>Open Github for Windows.</li>
			<li>Sign in with your Github username and password</li>
			<li>You’ll be asked to ‘configure git,’ enter your name and
				email and click ‘Continue’</li>
			<li>Github for Windows will then look for local repositories,
				just click ‘Skip’</li>
			<li>You’ll then be taken to the ‘repositories’ page</li>
			<li>
				<p>That’s it! You’re ready to start using Github for Windows.</p>
				<p>

				</p>
				<p>
					<em>The local repositories page you’ll see after setting up
						Github for Windows</em>
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Creating a repository</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>From your ‘repositories’ page, click ‘Create’</li>
			<li>Enter a name for the repository (the name cannot have spaces
				or ‘special characters’ like @/!$£ etc)</li>
			<li>Enter a description for the repository, something that makes
				sense to humans</li>
			<li>Select where you’d like to store the repository (your files)
				on your computer. Use the ‘Browse’ button to choose a location.</li>
			<li>
				<p>Lastly, click ‘Create’ at the bottom of the screen</p>
				<p>
					<img
						src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/localgovdigital/how-to-share-stuff/github-create.png"
						alt="The Github for windows app showing the create repository page"
						title="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Completing this screen and clicking ‘Create’ will create
						your repository</em>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>That’s it! Your repository has been created. Even though your
					repository is empty, if you go to
					http://github.com/your-username-here, you should now see your
					repository already available on the web.</p>
				<p>
					<img
						src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/localgovdigital/how-to-share-stuff/github-repository.png"
						alt="The Github for Windows home page showing the newly created repository"
						title="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Once your repository is created, you’ll be returned to the
						‘repositories’ page</em>
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Adding your files</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Copy and Paste or Cut and Paste your file(s) into the
				repository folder on your computer</li>
			<li>Open Github for Windows</li>
			<li>Double click on your repository, you’ll be taken to another
				screen</li>
			<li>The new screen will show you a list of the files that have
				changed, new files are treated as changes because technically, they
				are!</li>
			<li>We’re going to ‘commit’ the change we’ve made, at this point
				we’re saying ‘Yes, please save my files in this state so that if
				something goes horribly wrong, we can go back to this point.’</li>
			<li>
				<p>On the left of the screen, there is an ‘Uncommitted changes’
					box. This is where we can leave a message about the changes we’ve
					made</p>
				<p>
					<img
						src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/localgovdigital/how-to-share-stuff/github-add-files.png"
						alt="The Github for Windows repository page showing a list of files ready to be committed"
						title="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>The uncommitted changes will show up on the repository
						page ready for you to commit them</em>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Type in a summary of the changes in the ‘Summary’ field,
					something brief.</p>
			</li>
			<li>Type in a description of the changes in the ‘Description
				field, something that explains what you’ve done.</li>
			<li>Once you’ve put message in at least one of the boxes, click
				‘Commit to master.’</li>
			<li>Clicking ‘Commit to master’ takes a snapshot of your files
				in their current state so that we can go back to it later if we need
				to</li>
			<li>
				<p>Now we need to publish our ‘commit’ to Github so that it’s
					made public and other people can make use of our files. In Github
					for Windows this is simply a matter of clicking ‘publish’ in the
					top right hand corner.</p>
				<p>
					<img
						src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/localgovdigital/how-to-share-stuff/github-publish.png"
						alt="The Github for Windows repository page showing a committed change and an illuminated publish button"
						title="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Clicking the ‘publish’ button will push the changes up to
						Github and make them public.</em>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The ‘publish’ icon will change to a ‘sync’ icon once the
					‘commit’ has been published.</p>
			</li>
			<li>That’s it! Your files are now published to Github.</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Publishing a change</h4>
		<p>There will come a time when your published document needs
			updating, or maybe it’s a work in progress and you want to publish
			changes as you work. Here we’ll take you through publishing changes
			an existing repository to Github</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Any time a file in your repository folder changes, Github
				for Windows knows about the change. Changes that haven’t been
				committed and published are referred to as ‘Uncommitted changes.’</li>
			<li>To see uncommitted changes, open Github for Windows and
				double click on the repository that you’ve made changes to.</li>
			<li>
				<p>Github for Windows will then show you a list of the files
					that have changed.</p>
				<p>
					<img
						src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/localgovdigital/how-to-share-stuff/github-changes.png"
						alt="The Github for Windows app showing the repository page with changes to files highlighted in red and green"
						title="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Uncommitted changes will show as a list in your
						repository, changes are highlighted in red and green</em>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Before we can publish this change, we have to commit it.</p>
			</li>
			<li>In the ‘Uncommitted changes’ box, type in a summary of the
				changes in the ‘Summary’ field and a description in the
				‘Description’ field.</li>
			<li>
				<p>Click ‘Commit to master’ just below the ‘Description’ field.</p>
				<p>
					<img
						src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/localgovdigital/how-to-share-stuff/github-changes-unsynced.png"
						alt="The Github for Windows app showing the repository page with changes committed and an illuminated sync button"
						title="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Once your changes have been committed, they’ll show up in
						'Unsynced commits' until you sync your repository on Github</em>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>To publish this commit to Github, click ‘sync’ in the top
					right hand corner.</p>
			</li>
			<li>That’s it! You’ve published your changes to Github, visit <a
				href="http://www.github.com/your-username-here">http://www.github.com/your-username-here</a>
				to see your repository on Github
			</li>
